        <h4>2. Health Benefits:</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I. </b>Eating on a budget often involves cooking at home, which allows you to
            control ingredients and portion sizes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II. </b>Focusing on whole, unprocessed foods can improve your overall health and
            well-being.</p>
        <h4>3. Sustainability:</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I.</b> Budget eating often emphasizes using seasonal, local produce and minimizing
            waste, which is better for the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II.</b> Reducing reliance on processed and packaged foods can decrease your
            ecological footprint</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Strategies for Budget Eating</h4>
        <h4>1. Plan Your Meals</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I.</b> Create a weekly meal plan that includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
            This helps you avoid unnecessary purchases and ensures you use what you
            buy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II.</b> Incorporate ingredients that can be used in multiple dishes to maximize
            efficiency and reduce waste.</p>
        <h4>2. Make a Shopping List:</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I.</b> Based on your meal plan, make a detailed shopping list and stick to it. This
            minimizes impulse buys and ensures you get everything you need.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II.</b> Group items by category (produce, dairy, grains) to streamline your shopping
            trip and avoid wandering through aisles.</p>
        <h4>3. Buy in Bulk:</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I.</b> Purchase staple items like grains, beans, and pasta in bulk, as they are often
            cheaper per unit and have a long shelf life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II.</b> Look for bulk bins in grocery stores for spices, nuts, and dried fruits, which
            can be more affordable than pre-packaged options.</p>
        <h4>4. Embrace Seasonal and Local Produce:</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I.</b> Seasonal fruits and vegetables are typically less expensive and more flavourful
            than out-of-season varieties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II.</b> Visit local farmers' markets for fresh, affordable produce and support your
            local economy.</p>
        <h4>5. Cook in Batches:</h4>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I.</b> Prepare large quantities of meals and freeze portions for later. This saves time
            and money by reducing the need for takeout or pre-packaged meals.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II.</b> Batch cooking also allows you to buy ingredients in bulk, further reducing
            costs.</p>
        <h4>6. Reduce Meat Consumption:</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I.</b> Meat can be expensive, so try incorporating more plant-based meals into your
            Beans, lentils, and eggs are excellent,
            affordable protein sources.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II.</b> Experiment with "Meatless Monday" or other vegetarian days to explore new
            recipes and flavours.</p>
